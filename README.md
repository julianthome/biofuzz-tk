# What is biofuzz-tk

BioFuzz Toolkit helps you to parse strings and to perform operations (modification/extension) on the resulting parse trees. It is suited to programs that leverage genetic programming (GP) or similar techniques. The parsing and token-generation happens based on a context-free grammar description. Further, it supports the two well-known GP operations: Mutation and Crossover.
