- the biofuzz parser is not yet capable of dealing with left recursion.
	S -> Sa (not possible)
	S -> aS (possible)
	S -> a{a} (possible anyway)
- direct left recursion is detected. For now, these cases are eliminated.
- indirect left recursion is not detected yet (Have a look at the paper from Frost, R. et al.).
- mutators are only working for single terminal nodes.
